Analyzing Kickstarter data trends.
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

- The purpose of this project is to increase our ability to effectively communicate statistics using Microsoft Excel.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- In this section, we used the launch date to create a separate column which converted launch dates into a usable format which could then be filtered into quarters and months. We used this data to understand how outcomes correlated with varying months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- In this section, we wrote and applied an equation to gather information regarding success, failure, or cancellation rates among varying monetary benchmark goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- No challenges were experienced during the "Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date" section. Possible challenges to encounter may include incorrect categorization of different chart elements (such as filters or columns).

- No challenges were experienced during the "Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals" section. Possible challenges to encounter may include difficulty in writing code which correctly includes or excludes desired or undesired parameters, respectively.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Most successful projects launched during the middle of the year, with a peak in May. Failure rate of projects remained largely consistent throughout the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Outcomes generally remained similar regardless of goals except for projects with a goal of $1,000 or less. This may indicate that at some goal threshold, projects become significantly more likely to succeed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The variance per goal groups is large. Perhaps data could be more pertinently analyzed at smaller levels of variance; for instance, separating goal categories per every $200.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create a variety of other comparisons such as year vs. goal or percentage success vs percentage failure.
